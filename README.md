# Artificial-Neural-Network-and-Convolution-Neural-Network

Created scripts for ANN,DNN, and CNN from scratch to identfity handwritten digits from the MNIST data-set.

1) nnSctipt.py : Artificial Neural Network
2) deepnnScript.py:  Deep Neural Network
3) snnScript.py : Convoultion Neural Network
The observations and results are in the Machine Learning Report
